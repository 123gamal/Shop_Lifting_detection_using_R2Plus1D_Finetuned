🧠 R(2+1)D Video Classification Model

This project implements a video classification model based on the R(2+1)D (Residual (2+1)D Convolutional Network) architecture using PyTorch and Google Colab.
The model is trained on a custom dataset stored in Google Drive, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.86%.

Key features:

🎥 Processes spatio-temporal information from video frames.

⚙️ Trained using transfer learning for efficient convergence.

💾 Automatically saves the best-performing model (best_r2plus1d.pth) to Google Drive.

🔍 Easily reloadable for inference or continued training.
